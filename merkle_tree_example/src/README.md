# Merkle Tree example

In this example of the code, our goal is going to be to write a simple wrapper around the merkle tree implementation at
https://github.com/arkworks-rs/crypto-primitives/tree/main/src/merkle_tree,
for making a circuit that just verifies a single Merkle Tree authentication path.

This will showcase allocating variables into a circuit, and just using the arkworks API's.

TODO: Make a native version of the code.
